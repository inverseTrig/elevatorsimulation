# Elevator Simulator for HCI
This project is for a small elevator simulation for Human Computer Interaction.

There were two portions of work to be done: back-end and front-end. We modified the initial code that were given to us so that it could take the user's input as variables. To randomize the variables between two values, check the box next to the category, and write the values before and after the tilda "~". Currently doesn't have the option to specify the number of riders homed on each floor, thus, the code works when the values are randomized (please check the box).

We store a clone of the elevator at each step into an ArrayList<Elevator> that we use to step through the progress of the elevator as time goes by.
